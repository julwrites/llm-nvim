# Test Coverage Evaluation and Improvement Plan

## Summary

The repository has a decent foundation of tests, with good coverage of the `core` modules. However, there are significant gaps in the test coverage for the `managers` and `ui` modules, as well as the `facade.lua` file. These modules contain a large portion of the plugin's logic and user-facing features, so it's crucial that they are well-tested to ensure the plugin is reliable and maintainable.

## Testing Gaps

1.  **`lua/llm/facade.lua`**: This module, which serves as the main entry point for the plugin, is completely untested.

2.  **`lua/llm/managers/`**: None of the manager modules are tested. This is the most critical gap, as these modules contain the core logic for managing models, plugins, API keys, fragments, templates, and schemas.

3.  **`lua/llm/ui/`**: None of the UI modules are tested. While UI testing can be challenging in Neovim, the lack of any tests for the UI means that there is no automated way to verify that the UI is functioning correctly.

## Proposed Solutions

To address these gaps, I propose the following testing strategy:

### 1. `lua/llm/facade.lua`

*   **File:** `tests/spec/facade_spec.lua`
*   **Actions:**
    *   Verify that the `facade` module correctly delegates calls to the appropriate modules (`llm.commands` and the various manager modules).
    *   Use mocking to isolate the `facade` module from its dependencies.

### 2. `lua/llm/managers/`

*   **Files:** Create new test files for each manager module (e.g., `tests/spec/managers/models_manager_spec.lua`, `tests/spec/managers/plugins_manager_spec.lua`, etc.).
*   **Actions:** For each manager, add tests to verify the following:
    *   **Data retrieval and parsing**: Test that the manager correctly retrieves and parses data from the `llm-cli` and other external sources.
    *   **Caching**: Test that the manager correctly caches data.
    *   **Logic**: Test the core logic of the manager.
    *   **CLI interaction**: Test that the manager correctly calls the `llm-cli` with the correct arguments.
    *   **Buffer population**: Test that the manager correctly populates the buffer with the correct data for the TUI.

### 3. `lua/llm/ui/`

*   **`unified_manager.lua`**:
    *   **File:** `tests/spec/ui/unified_manager_spec.lua`
    *   **Actions:**
        *   Verify that the `unified_manager` correctly switches between views, sets the buffer name and window title, and calls the appropriate functions from the manager modules.
*   **`views/`**:
    *   Create integration-style tests that simulate user input and verify that the correct UI elements are displayed.

By implementing this testing strategy, we can significantly improve the test coverage of the repository, which will make the plugin more reliable, easier to maintain, and less prone to regressions.
